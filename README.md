# Simple To-Do List Web Application

This project aims to create a basic to-do list web application where students are required to fill in the JavaScript file.

## Assignment Details

### Task Description

The task is to complete the JavaScript file for a simple to-do list web application. The HTML and CSS starter code are provided, and students need to fill in the JavaScript file to implement the functionality of adding tasks, completing tasks, and removing tasks.

### Provided Files

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: Contains the styling for the web page.
- `app.js`: Initially empty JavaScript file. Students are required to fill in this file.

### Starter Code Overview

The provided JavaScript starter code contains event listeners for adding tasks, displaying tasks fetched from an API (which needs to be replaced with an actual API endpoint), functions for adding tasks, displaying tasks, completing tasks, and removing tasks.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the current state of the to-do list application.
3. Open the `app.js` file and fill in the JavaScript code as per the provided instructions.
4. Test your implementation by adding, completing, and removing tasks.
5. Optionally, you can style the application further by modifying the `styles.css` file.

## Requirements

- The simple to-do list web should be able to add, complete, and remove task.
- From the start, the web should display 3 random task from the API fetch.
- Implement validation to ensure that the user cannot add an empty task.
- Use DOM manipulation instead of `alert` for validation and interaction with the user.
- Maintain good code structure, use comments, and adhere to proper indentation.

## API Endpoint

For fetching tasks, replace `'your-api-endpoint'` with the actual API here `'https://module3-api-is2m.onrender.com/random-todos'`.
